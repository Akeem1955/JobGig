# JobGIG: Empowering Vocational Workers and Building Stronger Communities

Welcome to JobGIG, a platform designed to empower vocational workers by connecting them with potential employers, providing valuable tutorials, and facilitating access to workspace and tools.

## Features

### Connecting Vocational Workers with Employers
- JobGIG bridges the gap between vocational workers and employers, facilitating meaningful connections that lead to employment opportunities.

### Tutorial Uploads for Skill Enhancement
- Vocational workers can upload tutorials to share their expertise and help others upgrade their skills, fostering a supportive community of learning and growth.

### Workspace and Tools Requests
- Need a workspace or specific tools for your vocational work? JobGIG allows users to request these essentials from others in the community who are willing to donate or support financially.

## Requirements for Running the Code

To ensure smooth building and running of the code, we have included the Gradle build files in the repository, and the `google-services.json` file is also present. All you need to do is obtain a Google Maps API key and update its value in the `local.properties` file located under the build script directory. Simply insert your map API key as follows:

```
maps_api_key={Your Google Cloud API key}
```

This straightforward process will enable the integration of Google Maps functionality into the application seamlessly.

## Installation via APK

For an easy and hassle-free way to experience JobGIG, you can install the APK file directly. Find the APK in the [jobgig_apk](https://github.com/Akeem1955/JobGig/tree/master/jobgig_apk) directory.
